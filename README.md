# Sys_monitor

Sys_monitor is a graphical interface for 'lm-sensors' temperature readings.  
Also it shows frequency per core.  
For GNU/Linux.

# Some technical comments.

-Depends on lm-sensors to work.  
  
-Visual interface 'tkinter'.  
-Grabs data direct from STDOUT.  
-Default refresh rate 1000ms to reduce overhead.    

# Work in progress.

-Tweak the interface form and color style.  
-Settings window; user change max values and actions for critical values.
